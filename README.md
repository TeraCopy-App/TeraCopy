## ‚ö° Overview  

TeraCopy is a dedicated file management tool for Windows designed to make copying and moving files faster and more reliable. Unlike default system tools, it delivers higher speed, automatic error recovery, and detailed progress reports, which is particularly helpful for large file transfers.  

The program minimizes interruptions by retrying failed files and skipping damaged ones without halting the entire process. It also provides real-time file verification, ensuring that copies are identical to the originals for data integrity.  

With its simple and intuitive interface, TeraCopy integrates smoothly into Windows Explorer, replacing the standard copy dialog. This makes it easy to pause, resume, or manage ongoing transfers seamlessly.  

TeraCopy Pro adds advanced features like file selection filters, extended reporting, and enhanced error handling, making it ideal for IT specialists, system administrators, and power users who frequently work with large amounts of data.
